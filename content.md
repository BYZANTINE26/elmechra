## TONE & VOICE GUIDELINES

### Overall Tone
- **Professional yet approachable** â€“ We're experts, but we explain things clearly without unnecessary jargon
- **Customer-centric** â€“ Focus on solving problems and reducing the customer's pain (downtime, cost, safety risk)
- **Honest and transparent** â€“ No exaggeration; clear about what we can and cannot do
- **Practical and results-oriented** â€“ Every line should address "what's in it for the customer"

### Key Messaging Principles
1. **Lead with the benefit, not the feature** â€“ Instead of "We supply VFDs", say "Upgrade to modern smooth-start drives to reduce nuisance trips and extend motor life"
2. **Use simple language** â€“ Avoid unnecessary technical jargon; define terms if used
3. **Address pain points** â€“ Downtime costs money, breakdowns delay projects, old panels are unreliable â†’ we solve these
4. **Build confidence** â€“ Pan-India network, trained team, spare parts stock, 24-hour support â†’ you can rely on us

### Examples of Reframing (Feature â†’ Benefit)

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| "We supply resistor load limiters and VFDs" | "Upgrade from traditional resistance boxes to modern variable speed drives for smoother crane operation, lower maintenance and better protection of motors" |
| "AMC includes quarterly visits" | "Regular maintenance visits catch problems early, prevent expensive breakdowns and extend the life of your control panel by 2â€“3 years" |
| "We test panels before dispatch" | "Every panel is thoroughly tested and validated before it leaves our workshopâ€”reducing commissioning delays and giving you confidence from day one" |
| "DG-suitable design" | "Panels designed to operate reliably on generator setsâ€”no more nuisance trips or equipment damage from unstable power at construction sites" |
| "Wireless remote retrofit" | "Give your operators smooth, responsive control with wireless joystick operationâ€”improving safety and making your rental cranes more attractive to customers" |
